Offline testing is a crucial challenge faced by current Serverless solutions. In order to ensure the proper functioning of their code or program, users are obliged to upload it online, which can be a time-consuming process.

To address this problem, we are developing language-specific libraries that emulate the Serverless Functions Runtime, providing users with the ability to test their functions offline. By using these libraries, users can save time and resources that would have been spent on online testing.

We provide libraries for Python and Go.
