A container runtime is, as one of the lowest layers of a Kubernetes, the software that (besides of other tasks) ensures containers are started and stopped accordingly. Historically Kubernetes used Docker as container runtime, however with ongoing development it because clear that it is not totally adapted and with the rapid evolution of the container runtime universe it became clear that other solutions might be better adapted.
To open up Kubernetes to other container runtimes, the Container Runtime Interface (CRI) was developed. It a plugin in a Kubernetes cluster that enables the kubelet to use more than one type of container runtime. CRI consists of a protocol buffers and gRPC API, and libraries, with additional specifications and tools.

With Kubenernetes version 1.25 Scaleway Kubetnetes Kosmos will de deprecating Kubernetes interfaces named docker and cri-o. We focus on ContainerD, the state-of-the-art solution in the industry. 

If you are still using one of the deprecated container runtimes your cluster will have the following limitations:
